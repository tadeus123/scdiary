We were calling the day I showed them berkely. because I'm rigth now in the USA in berkely. actually. \n\nit was really cool to see my family together again. i mean there is some bad vibes some day. and mom, dad are not happy with each other. and this spreads over. but today was cool. \n\nalso my one grandmother that I do not have so much contact with had a awesome thing to tell about how they produce there morning act. \n\n- yeah so took some call with founders from sf for insurance -> im still not sure if this is the way to go... \n- figured out today that i need to set goals. because that's the only way live is not so confusing. Goals makes live easier to understand, because you can channel your focus on things that you think are important. \n- also I still believe we have no free will and everything is actually only a matter of what we observe which leads to, that our goals are also only a matter of what we observe. yes, but hopefully I observed good things. \n\n- im still broke (around -600€ on the bank) but confidente to change the world to something positive. I still believe that those who think they can change the world and thos who think they can't are both usually right.",
